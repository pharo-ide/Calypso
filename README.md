## Documentation

If you want to learn more about the architecture of Calypso, refer to the the [Pharo Infrascture mini booklet](https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/Booklet-Infrastructure) as well as the [ClassAnnotation project](https://github.com/pharo-ide/ClassAnnotation). 

The classes in the Calypso package also have some high level documentation as well.


## Problems
If you will find many processes hanging in the image it can be caused by some issue of critic plugin implementation. Some people report it in the past. It should be fixed now but there is always possibility that fix is not complete.

Following line should be enough to disable critic method group with all related computation. It is the main reason of that kind of problems:
```Smalltalk
ClyCriticEnvironmentPlugin disableMethodGroup.
```
It is not full critic disable. If it not helps then turn off it completely:
```Smalltalk
ClyCriticBrowserPlugin disable.
ClyCriticEnvironmentPlugin disable.
ClyNavigationEnvironment reset.
```
And please report this problem on issue tracker or with direct mail or Pharo mailing list.
