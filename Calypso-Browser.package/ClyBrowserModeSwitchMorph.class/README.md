I represent the command which switches the browser to particular mode.
Therefore I use radio button widget to reflect that target browser mode is already active.
I ask the activator #isCommandAppliedToBrowser to detect this state.
I implement this logic in the method #isModeActive.

When user click on radio button I just execute the command.
