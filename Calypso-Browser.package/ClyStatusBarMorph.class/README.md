I represent browser tab status bar.
I provide two panels where items can be added: 

- commandBar
- contextBar 

It should be redone because it is completely strange names and separation of these panels.

Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.

    Instance Variables
	commandBar:		<Morph>
	contextBar:		<Morph>
