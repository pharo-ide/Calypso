I run my subquery using background process.
I do not implement #buildResult: as other queries. 
Instead I return special ClyAsyncQueryResult instances to represent result of execution. 
Async result overrides building logic in the way that it forks actual query execution and updates itself when execution is completed. For details look at this class.
So I only implement hook which triggers background execution of actual query.

Any query can be converted to async query using:

	aQuery async 
	
It returns instance of me. And in case when I am receiver I just return myself.

While I am executed users can check the execution state. A ClyAsyncQueryResult is returned from #execute method which can be checked for the status:

	aQuery execute isBuilt
	
It returns true only when execution is completed.

For the empty test (#checkEmptyResult) I always return false when execution is still in progress. Idea that we do not know exactly if result would be empty or not. And for many scenarios it is convenient to get false in that case.
