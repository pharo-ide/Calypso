I represent collection of items retrieved by query from environment. 
My subclasses implement specific format or transformation of items. They should implement method:

- fillWith: items 

Any query has special parameter #requiredResult which specifies what kind of result should represent retrieved items. It is an instance of result which is used as prototype to create actual result instances. 

When query is executed at first time the navigation environment prepares new instance of required result:
	
	actualResult := aQuery prepareNewResult.

where query asks #requiredResult for: 

	actualResult := requiredResult prepareNewFor: aQuery in: environment

Then actualResult is cached using query as a key. And subsequent query execution just returns existing value.

Thus my instances describe required result and they can be implemented using composition of other objects. So different instances of same result class can lead to different result of query.
For example there is ClySortedQueryResult with #sortFunction variable. It allows to sort retrieved items using different criteria and different direction (ascending or descending).

Since requiredResult is part of query it is used in query comparison and hashing logic. And therefore my subclasses should correctly implement equality and hash operations when they introduce new parameters.
Also instances which are used as required result should be immutable because instead modification of result can corrupt cache of queries. 
To ensure this property #requiredResult is marked as readOnlyObject when it is assigned to the query.

Actual query execution is initiated by me using method #rebuildIfNeeded. Navigation environment calls it before returning result to the user.

I maintain special flag #needsRebuild to detect that existing items are dirty or are not built yet. So at first time #rebuildIfNeeded will lead to actual query execution (result building). But then it will do nothing until update will be not requested again.

So #rebuildIfNeeded will call #rebuild which will ask #buildingQuery to build result: 

	aQuery buildResult: self 

At the end aQuery fills result instance with items retrieved from the scope of environment.

Notice that #rebuild itself is private method. Users should use #rebuildIfNeeded. In fact users do not need it too because it is lazely evaluated when my items are accessed. But in case when query is executed it is evaluated explicitly by navigation environment. So callers always receive fresh result.

In the case when you want force items update there are two methods: 

- forceRebuild 
It set flag #needsRebuild to true and notify observers about changes (observers will be explained below).

- forceLazyRebuild 
It silently set flag #needsRebuild to true without any notification to observers.

In first case observers can handle notification by requesting new items from the result instance.
For example if UI widget observes result items and shows them to the user the #forceRebuild message will update shown items immediately. 
But #forceLazyRebuild will not update items until user request it manually.
In addition both methods reset items to nil.

There is extra helper method #cancelRebuild which reset rebuild flag and reset items to the empty collection.

My instances are safe to be used from multiple processes. Building and updating of items are protected by my #accessGuard mutex.

I provide several methods to access built items: 

- itemsStartingAt: startIndex count: size

- itemsStartingWhere: conditionBlock count: size
It finds first item where condition is true and then it returns "size" items starting from the found position

- itemsWhere: conditionBlock
It collects all items where conditionBlock is true

- allItems

- size

- isEmpty

These methods are safe to be used at any time: when user calls them I first ensure that items are ready and if not I rebuild them. 
Also I protect these methods by #accessGuard mutex. So it is safe to access items from multiple processes.
To ensure this logic I use helper method #protectItemsWhile:.

So I am cached by navigation environment. And this cache requires updates when underlying system is changed.
For this purpose navigation environment subscribes on system changes. And when any change happens the environment asks every result in cache to handle given event object:

	aQueryResult handleSystemChange: aSystemAnnouncement
 
To handle system change I ask my #buildingQuery if it is affected by given event. And if it is affected I force rebuild using #itemsChanged method where I announce that I was changed.
I allow my users to be notified when my items are changed. Users should subscribe to me using #subscribe: method:
	
	aQueryResult subscribe: anObserver 
	
Underhood I subscribe anObserver for ClyEnvironmentChanged to my #announcer. And it will be notified using #itemsChanged message. So observers should implement this method.
Also observers must #unsubscribe: when they are not interested anymore. 

For the UI support I provide special stream kind access in the form of ClyBrowserQueryCursor instance which returns items as ClyBrowserItem instances.
ClyBrowserItem is a wrapper over actual result item which provides UI specific information like position in the result, depth in the hierarchy and extendable set of properties related to the underlying object.
To get cursor instance you should open it for concrete observer:

	cursor := aQueryResult openBrowserCursorFor: anObserver

anObserver will be subscribed on my changes and new cursor instance will be return to the caller.
When cursor is not needed anymore it should be closed. It will unsubscribe observer in addition:

	cursor close

With cursor you are able access items as ClyBrowserItem instances. For example: 

	cursor currentItem.
	cursor moveToNext.
	cursor findItemsWhere: conditionBlock 
	
The important responsibility of cursor is to organize cache of retrieved browser items. It is especially important for remote scenario where cache represents loaded remote items. But also it caches all extended properties collected for items by environment plugins.  
For more details about cursor look at ClyBrowserQueryCursor comments. And read comments of ClyBrowserItem.

The last feature which I provide for my subclasses is metadata. I compute it lazily on demand and keed it in the #metadata variable. Metadata is updated together with items. So when items are changed the metadata is reset and subsequent call for it will recompute it again.
The metadata is an instance of ClyQueryResultMetadata which represent extended properties of result in general. For example the result of class query can include the count of success tests as metadata property.
And properties are represented by first class objects, a kind of ClyBrowserItemProperty.
The metadata is collected using environment plugins. So it is extended by them. 
Plugins collect information of concrete type of result items. For example: 
	
		plugin collectMetadataOfClasses: aQueryResult
		plugin collectMetadataOfMethods: aQueryResult
		
The decision what method to use is responsibility of #buildingQuery which knows what kind of items it retrieves:

	metadata := ClyQueryResultMetadata new.
	environment pluginsDo: [:each | 
		buildingQuery collectMetadataOf: self by: each	]

So every query class should implement the method #collectMetadataOf:by:.

To access metadata there are several methods:

- addMetaProperty: anBrowserItemProperty
- getMetaProperty: aPropertyClass
- hasMetaProperty: aPropertyClass	
- metadata

Same protocol is also implemented in ClyBrowserQueryCursor. So with cursor instance you are also able to access metadata of query result.
